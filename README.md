# SIP-RTM-Leaf

## File Description
  1.Please start with the SIP_Main.m, which is the main function and can display the output figures.
  
  2.leaf_parameter.txt is the input parameters, and the description of the order of input is in SIP_Main.m. You can also provide the input in SIP_Main.m after slightly changing the code.
  
  3.leaf_spectrum.txt is the output, and the order is [wavelength, leaf single scattering albedo, leaf reflectance, leaf transmittance].
  
  4.The key code of the SIP model is in SIP_Model.m, which only has a few lines in addition to the description of the input parameters.Â 
  
  5.dataSpec_PDB.m and calctav.m are about the specific absorption coefficient of leaf biochemical constituents, which do not need the users to be quite familiar with.
